# ECS188 Discussion Facilitation

You and your essay partner will facilitate an in-class discussion.

## Step 1: Select readings and announce via Canvas Discussions.

- Select one or more readings.
- Limit your readings to approximately 10-40 pages of material.
- If you have denser material (research articles, technical blog posts/essays, moral/ethical theory), consider limiting to a single reading, or limiting the total number of pages.
- If you want to use lighter material (for example most news/pop sci articles), consider selecting multiple readings.

## Step 2: Prepare prompts/questions for student discussion.

- Prepare questions and/or prompts for discussion
- Some strategies for encouraging discussion:
  - What was a standout claim from on of your readings? Quote or paraphrase it and ask the group what they thought.
  - Consider two or more ways that your readings could be interpreted. Submit these to the group and ask them to consider which is the more appropriate/natural/intuitive way of viewing things.
  - Ask the group if they thought of any real-world connections while reading

## Step 3a: Lead the discussion

- Think of yourself as serving the group. As a facilitator, your primary role is not presenting your own opinion. Your primary role is to encourage a quality conversation on the topic of your choice.
- As a discussion facilitator, you want to strike a balance between letting an organic conversation develop and intervening to keep things on track.
- Strategies for facilitation:
  - **Be patient** after you pose a question to the group. Sometimes folks need time to form thoughts.
  - **Watch for non-verbal cues.** If it looks like someone has something to say but hasn't found a chance, you can offer them an opportunity to jump in.
  - **Don't make too many assumptions** about what discussion participants believe. Sometimes people state opinions definitively, when they are not actually that certain. Compare "So you're saying that ..." with "I could see how someone could think that ..."
  - **Restate contributions** if you think they were not heard well (for example if the speaker was quiet)
  - **Lead through questions**. If you have something from the reading that you want to bring into the discussion, try to pull it out of others in the group. You can try asking the group a question that leads towards the focal point you wanted to bring up.
  - **Eye on the prize.** Keep an eye on what ethical issues are at stake.
  - **Untangle** multiple discussion threads if having multiple issues gets to confusing.
  - **Challenge Assumptions** If discussion participants say things like "free markets always do X", or "it's impossible to build technology that does Y", you can challenge these generalizations. Try "What makes you say that?".

## Step 3b: Take notes during the discussion

At all times during the discussion, one of your group of two should be taking notes. These notes will be used to write the summary (see the following section).

It is expected that these notes and the resulting summary will not be shared outside the class. If you think that some students will not want their contributions "on-record", even if the record is shared only within the class, you can establish a norm for this at the beginning of the discussion.

For example, at the beginning of your discussion you might say:

> We'll be taking notes on this conversation, but we won't share these outside of the class. If you have a contribution to make that you want excluded even from these notes, you can preface your contribution with "This is off the record..."

Submit your notes as notes.md in your fork of this repo.

## Step 4: Reflect

Reflect on the discussion. You may find it useful to plan for a debrief meeting with your co-facilitator -- it's up to you to organize this if you prefer.

## Step 4: Write a 500-1000 word summary of your discussion and submit it here.

Comment on how the group discussion and subsequent reflection has shaped your thinking as related to your paper topic.

Submit your summary as summary.md in your fork of this repo.

## Tips:
Use the discussion to your advantage for the final paper. You can use your discussion to:
- Get your classmates to "pre-digest" a lengthy reading for you
- Use the discussion to encourage others to assess the strengths and weaknesses of your thesis.
